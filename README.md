# week-4-game

2/21/2018: <br></br>
Week-4-Game would have benefited from a more descriptive title; it is a numbers-based game that requires a user to click on crystals until a random number is matched. For this HW assignment, I dramatically de-emphasized design elements in favor of the Javascript elements, which had been addressed last and hurriedly in earlier assignments. So, this project may not be much to look at, but should be fully-functional. Future updates are possible.
