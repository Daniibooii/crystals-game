# crystals-game

# Project Description
Crystals Game would have benefited from a more descriptive title;<br>
it is a numbers-based game that requires a user to click on crystals until a random number is matched,<br>
and was creating during my fourth week of "intensive" attempts at coding.<br>

For this project, I dramatically de-emphasized design elements in favor of the Javascript elements.<br>
These had been neglected in earlier work and needed practice.<br>
Publicly-available source code for similar games was consulted.<br>

So, this project may not be much to look at, but should be fully-functional.<br>

# Notes
Future updates are possible, with a focus on design elements.<br>
